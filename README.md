# unit-4-game

### Overview
This is an interactive web game that was created with the intent of practicing jQuery. It also uses javascript, CSS Bootstrap and HTML. This is an Game of Thrones Themed RPG style click game. Start off by selecting a character and then a competing character to go against. You must defeat all the remaining players to win the game. Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power.For example, if the base Attack Power is 6, each attack will increase the Attack Power by 6 (12, 18, 24, 30 and so on)

### Purpose
This project was essential in helping me learn jQuery events, selectors and syntax. Combined with the formatting of bootstrap it was a very fun and challenging project to work on. 

### Maintenance and Contact
I maintain this project and if you have any questions, comments or concerns, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me.
